Welcome to my poetry —a quiet space where words meet the natural world, and observations transform into verse.

Each poem here is an attempt to capture the ephemeral: the way light filters through autumn leaves, the silence between stars, the persistent flow of a river that knows more than we ever will.

This collection explores themes of nature, memory, and the human condition through a lens of contemplation and wonder. Poetry, for me, is both a practice of attention and an act of reverence.
