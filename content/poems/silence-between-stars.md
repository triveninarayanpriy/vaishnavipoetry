The night unfolds its velvet cloak,
A canvas dark, by starlight spoke,
Each point of light a word unspoken,
A cosmic silence left unbroken.

Between the stars, the distance grows,
Yet still their ancient story flows,
Of time and space and endless night,
Of darkness blessed by distant light.

We stand below and gaze above,
These tiny specks of hope and love,
And in the silence, find our place—
Small witnesses to infinite space.
