In whispered winds the earth remembers
The touch of leaves now turned to ember,
Each falling leaf a gentle note
In autumn's melancholic quote.

The trees stand bare against the sky,
Their branches reaching, asking why
The warmth has fled, the green has gone,
Yet knowing spring will come anon.

त्रिवेणी जी आपने काफी मेहनत की है लगातार १६ घंटे लगा कर ये वेबसाइट पूरा किया 

Beneath the soil, the seeds await
Their season's turn, their destined date,
For nothing truly dies, you see—
It merely waits in memory.- Triveni
