In the silence between stars,
where light bends and travels,
I find the spaces where words dissolve
into something larger than themselves.

The night sky holds no answers,
only questions reflected
in the eyes of those who dare
to look upward and wonder.

What is it we seek
in the infinite darkness?
Perhaps not light,
but permission to fall quietly
into the depths of our own becoming.
