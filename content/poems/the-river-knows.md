The river carries ancient songs
Of mountain springs and rights and wrongs,
It winds through valleys, deep and wide,
A liquid path, a flowing guide.

It knows the stones beneath its bed,
The fish that swim, the life it's fed,
It whispers secrets to the shore,
Of all the souls who came before.

The river never stops to rest,
Forever moving east to west,
And in its constant, ceaseless flow,
Are all the things we'll never know.
